WARNING — PROTECTED CORE

THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS THE WEBKERNEL™ CORE.
IT IS A CONTROLLED AND GOVERNED COMPONENT.
ANY MODIFICATION IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

WebKernel™ is the intellectual property of Numerimondes.
The core is released under a free software license, but its integrity,
identity, and compatibility are contractually and technically governed.

Numerimondes is the sole author, maintainer, and guarantor of WebKernel™.
Only unmodified cores are eligible for updates, security patches,
marketplace modules, enterprise support, and certifications.

Any alteration, fork, patch, or derivative voids all guarantees,
loses access to modules and services, and risks silent incompatibilities,
security regressions, and systemic degradation. Such versions are
independent, unsupported, and untrusted. They are not recognized
as WebKernel™ and must not present themselves as such.

Maintenance, security, compliance, and legal responsibility for modified
versions rest solely and exclusively with the modifying party.

Numerimondes reserves the right to deny marketplace access, revoke update
channels, refuse support, and reject certification for altered cores.

Contributions are accepted only through the official process, via pull
requests reviewed and validated by Numerimondes.

WebKernel™ is open core, but Numerimondes remains the reference authority
for its evolution, security, and long-term stability.

DO NOT MODIFY THIS CORE UNLESS YOU FULLY ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES.
