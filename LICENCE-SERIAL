WARNING — PROTECTED CORE

THIS DIRECTORY CONTAINS THE WEBKERNEL™ CORE.
IT IS A CONTROLLED AND GOVERNED COMPONENT.
ANY MODIFICATION IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED.

WebKernel™ is the intellectual property of Numerimondes.
The serial embedded in this core is not a secret or a cryptographic key,
but an identity marker. It carries minimal information:

    • Version WebKernel (e.g. 1.0.0)
    • Release year (e.g. 2025)
    • Unique suffix (e.g. a3f7b9c2)

This serial is an instance label: it declares “I am such version, released
in such year.” Integrity, identity, and compatibility are contractually
and technically governed by Numerimondes.

Numerimondes is the sole author, maintainer, and guarantor of WebKernel™.
Only unmodified cores, with their original serials, are eligible for
updates, security patches, marketplace modules, enterprise support,
and certifications.

Any alteration, fork, patch, or derivative voids all guarantees,
loses access to modules and services, and risks silent incompatibilities,
security regressions, and systemic degradation. Such versions are
independent, unsupported, and untrusted. They are not recognized
as WebKernel™ and must not present themselves as such.

Maintenance, security, compliance, and legal responsibility for modified
versions rest solely and exclusively with the modifying party.

Numerimondes reserves the right to deny marketplace access, revoke update
channels, refuse support, and reject certification for altered cores.

Contributions are accepted only through the official process, via pull
requests reviewed and validated by Numerimondes.

WebKernel™ is open core, but Numerimondes remains the reference authority
for its evolution, security, and long-term stability. The distant server
knows the list of valid instances, distinguishes enterprise from
governmental clients, and decides which special modules are delivered.

Local instances never know in advance what they will receive; they simply
identify themselves by their serial and await the server’s decision.

DO NOT MODIFY THIS CORE UNLESS YOU FULLY ACCEPT THE CONSEQUENCES.
